WordCloud for Python documentation
==================================

Here you find instructions on how to create wordclouds with my Python wordcloud project. 
Compared to other wordclouds, my algorithm has the advantage of

* filling all available space.
* being able to use arbitraty masks.
* having a stupid simple algorithm (with an efficient implementation) that can be easily modified.
* being in Python

Check out the :ref:`example_gallery`.

The code of the project is on Github: `word_cloud <https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud>`_
