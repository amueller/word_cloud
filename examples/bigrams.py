"""
Using bigrams and from_frequencies
==================================
We are using a custom tokenizer (here implemented from scratch, it's recommended to
use nltk, spacy or scikit-learn instead), to allow the inclusion of word-pairs
(bigrams, 2-grams) into the word cloud.

The ``from_frequencies`` method allows generating wordclouds from a list or
array of ``(word, frequency)`` tuples, where ``word`` can be any string, and
``frequency`` can be any int or float.


We are using the likelihood ratio score developed by Dunning to find "collocations",
which are phrases made up of two or more words (we only consider two here).
If the chance that a bigram is a collocation is high, we discount the appearances
of the single words -- otherwise they would always be at least as big as the bigram.
